My Personal Dotfiles
==
Installation
--
I use [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) to manage my dotfiles.

You need to (install yadm)[https://yadm.io/docs/install] first, and run `yadm clone` to install the dotfiles into your system.
```sh
$ yadm clone https://github.com/spitulax/dotfiles
```
